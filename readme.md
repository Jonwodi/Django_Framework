# Setting Up a Project - Writing a Spec
A full spec (specification) details the project goals, describes the project's functionality, and discusses its appearance and user interface.

# Setting Up a Project - Creating a Virtual Environment
To have access to and be able to work with Django we first have to set up a virtual environment. A virtual environment is place on your system where you can install packages and isolate them from all other python packages.

Step 1: Create a new directory (folder) using the command (mkdir project_name) using a terminal e.g. windows powershell for window users. 

Step 2: Then use the command (cd) to enter that directory that you created. Then open that directory in a text editor (visual studio code) using the command (code .).

Step 3: Once the project folder is open in visual studio code, start a terminal and enter the command (pipenv shell), to create and activate a virtual environment for your project.
